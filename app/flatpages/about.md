ContentDB was created by [rubenwardy](https://rubenwardy.com/) in 2018, he was lucky enough to have the time available
as it was submitted as university coursework. To learn about the history and development of ContentDB,

## Why was ContentDB created?

Before ContentDB, users had to manually install mods and games by unzipping their files into a directory. This is
poor user experience, especially for first-time users.

ContentDB isn't just about supporting the in-game content downloader; it's common for technical users to find
and review packages using the ContentDB website, but install using Git rather than the in-game installer.
**ContentDB's purpose is to be a well-formatted source of information about mods, games,
and texture packs for Minetest**.
