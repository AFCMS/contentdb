title: Editors

## What should editors do?

Editors are users of rank Editor or above.
They are responsible for ensuring that the package listings of ContentDB are useful.
For this purpose, they can/will:

* Review and approve packages.
* Edit any package - including tags, releases, screenshots, and maintainers.
* Create packages on behalf of authors who aren't present.

Editors should make sure they are familiar with the
[Package Inclusion Policy and Guidance](/policy_and_guidance/).

## ContentDB is not a curated platform

It's important to note that ContentDB isn't a curated platform, but it also does have some
requirements on minimum usefulness. See 2.2 in the [Policy and Guidance](/policy_and_guidance/).

## Editor Work Queue

The [Editor Work Queue](/todo/) and related pages contain useful information for editors, such as:

* The package, release, and screenshot approval queues.
* Packages which are outdated or are missing tags.
* A list of forum topics without packages.
  Editors can create the packages or "discard" them if they don't think it's worth adding them.

## Editor Notifications

Editors currently receive notifications for any new thread opened on a package, so that they
know when a user is asking for help. These notifications are shown separately in the notifications
interface, and can be configured separately in Emails and Notifications.
