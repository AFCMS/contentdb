title: Content Flags

Content flags allow you to hide content based on your preferences.
The filtering is done server-side, which means that you don't need to update
your client to use new flags.

## Flags

* `nonfree` - can be used to hide packages which do not qualify as
	'free software', as defined by the Free Software Foundation.
* A content rating, given below.


## Ratings

Content ratings aren't currently supported by ContentDB.
Instead, mature content isn't allowed at all for now.

In the future, more mature content will be allowed but labelled with
content ratings which may contain the following:

* android_default - meta-rating which includes gore and drugs.
* desktop_default - meta-rating which won't include anything for now.
* gore - more than just blood
* drugs
* swearing
