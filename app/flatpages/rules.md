title: Rules

The following are the rules for user behaviour on ContentDB, including reviews,
threads, comments, and profiles. For packages, see the
[Package Inclusion Policy](/policy_and_guidance/).

1. **Be respectful:** attacks towards any person or group, slurs,
    trolling/baiting, and other toxic behavior are not welcome.
2. **Assume good faith:** communication over the Internet is hard, try to assume
    good faith when eg: responding to reviews.
3. **No sexual content** and ensure you keep discussion appropriate given the
    package's [content warnings](/help/content_flags/).

You can report things by clicking [report](/report/) in the footer of pages you
want to report.
